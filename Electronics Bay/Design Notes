Avionics Bay Design
Materials:
wall: 6’’ bluetube (made of of cellulose fiber), more durable and less brittle than phenolic tubes, less expensive than carbon fiber
Bulkheads & sled: clear polycarbonate (PC): greater tensile strength than fiberglass; easier to drill or cut;

Parts in bay:
All parts will be screwed on the sled and secured with zip ties
Teensy3.2 with prop shield & battery; --microcontroller for (optional) auto-stabilizing, driving the cameras, data-logging and payload deployment
Stratologger Altimeter w/ 3S lipo battery; -- primary dual deployment altimeter
Redundant flight computer(Raven or Telemetrum) w/ 3S lipo battery; 
XBee-Pro: 900 MHz flight-ground communication
Rotary switch

Altimeter static ports:
One of the static ports functions as a hole for the rotary switch as well
Number & size: 0.26’’ diameter holes * 3;
Position: 2.5’’ from the bottom of the electronics bay;
Calculation references: StaticPorts AltimeterPortSizing

Camera: Mobius2 Action Camera + 808 Keychain camera
Mounting:
Both cameras can be mounted to the outside wall of the rocket body
Mobius points downward and the keychain camera points horizontally or upward
The keychain camera could be put in the nose cone as an alternative solution

Turn on/off the cameras
Both cameras can be driven by the Teensy with direct wire connection
Put a relay in parallel with the power on/off button and recording on/off button of the Mobius2; then use the teensy to drive the relay so that recording automatically starts after the launch and stops when the flight mission ends. TweakMobius2Chip 

Data Storage
Each camera carries a 16GB SD card (without any external power supply Mobius2 can record for about  2 hr 15 min, the keychain camera 60 min). Videos are exported to a PC after each flight.
